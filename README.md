## Environment Setup

Run the setup script to configure the environment:

```bash
source utils/setup-env.sh
```

## Requirements Lock Files

The `requirements-*.lock` files are platform-specific dependency snapshots for reference only:

- `requirements-blackwell.lock` - NVIDIA Blackwell GPU (RTX PRO 6000, sm_120)
- `requirements-hopper.lock` - NVIDIA Hopper GPU (if available)

These files are generated by `conda list --export` and may vary across different GPU architectures due to CUDA version requirements. Use the setup script for automatic environment configuration.

## Project Structure

- `cutile-tutorial/` - cuTile programming tutorials
- `hw1-asr/` - Homework 1: Automatic Speech Recognition
