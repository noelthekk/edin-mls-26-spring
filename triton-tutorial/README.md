# Triton Tutorial

Triton GPU programming tutorials corresponding to the cuTile examples.

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Environment

If you are using the project environment:

```bash
# Run from project root
bash utils/setup-env.sh
```

Or install Triton + PyTorch directly:

```bash
pip install triton torch
```

### 2. Activate Environment

```bash
conda activate mls
```
